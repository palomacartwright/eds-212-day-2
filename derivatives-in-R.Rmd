### Derivates in R 

Find the derivate expression and slope at the indicated value for each of the following 

Question A 

$f(x) = x^2$ at $x = 3$

```{r}

fx <- expression(x^2)

df_dx <- D(expr = fx, name = "x")

df_dx

x <- 3 

eval(expr = df_dx)

```


Question B 

$P(a) = 2(3a+2)^4 - 5$ at $a = 1.2$

```{r}

Pa <- expression(2 * (3 * a + 2) ^ 4 - 5)

dP_da <- D(expr = Pa, name = "a")

dP_da

a <- 1.2 

eval(expr = dP_da)

```
